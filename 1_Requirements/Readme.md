## Research

The technological development and impact of computers and internet on our lives
 that has been verified over time affected various sectors of activity.
 And almost every task today is being run through computers. Getting information and
 quickly turning it into a product that consumers want is the essential key to staying in business and 
 all of this is done nowadays using computers and applications or information systems.
 And the education system is undeniably the backbone of the society, 
 it focusses at preparing the young talents for the future. 
 However, currently the process of  result analysis and declaration  is performed manually with extensive human intervention,
 the results are generated through a spreadsheet application and then printed on a paper, attached to a wall for declaration and then stored. 
 The current research aims at creating a employees result management system, reducing time, effort and improving security. 
 The methodology adopted for the elaboration of the research is based on qualitative study.
 
 The main objective of this research is to enhance and automate the management and declaration of  results analysis using a computerized system.

## STATE OF ART
### Definitions of problems
Current system is bit time consuming as they require some amount of work to be done prior for example creating an excel sheet which contains  information like marks, personal details or enter all these details manually

Disadvantages of Existing System:

- The current system is time consuming.
- In current system, some manual work is to be done which makes it complex.
- In current system user must have some knowledge about creating and managing the particular file which is to be upload to the system for data extraction
- Some of the current software are not platform independent.


## Advantages
